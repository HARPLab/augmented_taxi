# Improving the Transparency of Agent Decision Making Using Demonstrations

This repository contains the raw code for all of the methods and environments (e.g. an augmented variant of the Taxi domain [Dietterich, JAIR2000]) described in the following [thesis](https://symikelee.github.io/papers/ml5_phd_ri_2024.pdf): 

- Michael S. Lee, **Improving the Transparency of Agent Decision Making Using Demonstrations**, Carnegie Mellon University, 2024,

which introduces a closed-loop teaching framework for teaching agent decision making to humans through demonstrations of key agent decisions, intermittent testing of human understanding, and provision of remedial instruction as necessary.

Please find the code for the individual methods and user studies the comprise chapters/papers of the thesis on Mike's [website](https://symikelee.github.io/) or [Github](https://github.com/symikelee/), which will likely be more digestible. 

Some of the required packages include [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [pypoman](https://github.com/stephane-caron/pypoman) to perform computational geometry with polytopes, and [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news) if you want to visualize some MDPs.
