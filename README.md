# Improving the Transparency of Agent Decision Making Using Demonstrations

This repository contains the raw code for all of the methods and environments (e.g. an augmented variant of the Taxi domain [Dietterich, JAIR2000]) described in the following [thesis](https://symikelee.github.io/papers/ml5_phd_ri_2024.pdf): 

- Michael S. Lee, **Improving the Transparency of Agent Decision Making Using Demonstrations**, Carnegie Mellon University, 2024,

with the goal of helping humans generalize to the agent's overall decision making in a particular domain by showing key agent decisions and behaviors to humans.

Please find the code for the individual methods and user studies the comprise chapters/papers of the thesis on Mike's [website](https://symikelee.github.io/) or [Github](https://github.com/symikelee/), which will likely be more digestible. 

Some of the required packages include [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [pypoman](https://github.com/stephane-caron/pypoman) to perform computational geometry with polytopes, and [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news) if you want to visualize some MDPs.
